Putting together a demo application built on BirdBase.

This application illustrates how to boot the configuration, map views and URLs for the navigator, and do some straightforward on-demand asset loading.

There are several views.

 1. Navigation view - shows how to access menu info from the configuration and build some menu buttons.

 1. Background view - loads a basic image on registration and displays it.

 1. Home view - a blank view.

 1. Media view & News view - both display two images in draggable windows.
